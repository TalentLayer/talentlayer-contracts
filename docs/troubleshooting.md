# Troubleshooting

## Deploy

- Due to slow network on sometimes on testnet, there is a wait in the execution off `setup-allFakeData`
- Error `no such file or directory, open ... artifacts`: launch `npx hardhat clean`

## Subgraph

- If you have some issues using Graph-CLI command, please install it globally
- if the `make regenerate` or npm command doesn't work correctly please launch the graph command individualy
